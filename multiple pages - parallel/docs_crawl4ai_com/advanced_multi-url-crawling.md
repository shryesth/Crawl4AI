# Optimized Multi-URL Crawling
> **Note** : We’re developing a new **executor module** that uses a sophisticated algorithm to dynamically manage multi-URL crawling, optimizing for speed and memory usage. The approaches in this document remain fully valid, but keep an eye on **Crawl4AI** ’s upcoming releases for this powerful feature! Follow [@unclecode](https://docs.crawl4ai.com/advanced/multi-url-crawling/<https:/twitter.com/unclecode>) on X and check the changelogs to stay updated.
Crawl4AI’s **AsyncWebCrawler** can handle multiple URLs in a single run, which can greatly reduce overhead and speed up crawling. This guide shows how to:
1. **Sequentially** crawl a list of URLs using the **same** session, avoiding repeated browser creation. 2. **Parallel** -crawl subsets of URLs in batches, again reusing the same browser. 
When the entire process finishes, you close the browser once—**minimizing** memory and resource usage.
## 1. Why Avoid Simple Loops per URL?
If you naively do:
```
for url in urls:
  async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    result = await crawler.arun(url)

```

You end up:
  1. Spinning up a **new** browser for each URL 
  2. Closing it immediately after the single crawl 
  3. Potentially using a lot of CPU/memory for short-living browsers 
  4. Missing out on session reusability if you have login or ongoing states


**Better** approaches ensure you **create** the browser once, then crawl multiple URLs with minimal overhead.
## 2. Sequential Crawling with Session Reuse
### 2.1 Overview
1. **One** `AsyncWebCrawler` instance for **all** URLs. 2. **One** session (via `session_id`) so we can preserve local storage or cookies across URLs if needed. 3. The crawler is only closed at the **end**.
**This** is the simplest pattern if your workload is moderate (dozens to a few hundred URLs).
### 2.2 Example Code
```
import asyncio
from typing import List
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.markdown_generation_strategy import DefaultMarkdownGenerator
async def crawl_sequential(urls: List[str]):
  print("\n=== Sequential Crawling with Session Reuse ===")
  browser_config = BrowserConfig(
    headless=True,
    # For better performance in Docker or low-memory environments:
    extra_args=["--disable-gpu", "--disable-dev-shm-usage", "--no-sandbox"],
  )
  crawl_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    markdown_generator=DefaultMarkdownGenerator()
  )
  # Create the crawler (opens the browser)
  crawler = AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config)
  await crawler.start()
  try:
    session_id = "session1" # Reuse the same session across all URLs
    for url in urls:
      result = await crawler.arun(
        url=url,
        config=crawl_config,
        session_id=session_id
      )
      if result.success:
        print(f"Successfully crawled: {url}")
        # E.g. check markdown length
        print(f"Markdown length: {len(result.markdown_v2.raw_markdown)}")
      else:
        print(f"Failed: {url} - Error: {result.error_message}")
  finally:
    # After all URLs are done, close the crawler (and the browser)
    await crawler.close()
async def main():
  urls = [
    "https://example.com/page1",
    "https://example.com/page2",
    "https://example.com/page3"
  ]
  await crawl_sequential(urls)
if __name__ == "__main__":
  asyncio.run(main())

```

**Why It’s Good** :
  * **One** browser launch. 
  * Minimal memory usage. 
  * If the site requires login, you can log in once in `session_id` context and preserve auth across all URLs.


## 3. Parallel Crawling with Browser Reuse
### 3.1 Overview
To speed up crawling further, you can crawl multiple URLs in **parallel** (batches or a concurrency limit). The crawler still uses **one** browser, but spawns different sessions (or the same, depending on your logic) for each task.
### 3.2 Example Code
For this example make sure to install the [psutil](https://docs.crawl4ai.com/advanced/multi-url-crawling/<https:/pypi.org/project/psutil/>) package.
```
pip install psutil

```

Then you can run the following code:
```
import os
import sys
import psutil
import asyncio
__location__ = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
__output__ = os.path.join(__location__, "output")
# Append parent directory to system path
parent_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
sys.path.append(parent_dir)
from typing import List
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode
async def crawl_parallel(urls: List[str], max_concurrent: int = 3):
  print("\n=== Parallel Crawling with Browser Reuse + Memory Check ===")
  # We'll keep track of peak memory usage across all tasks
  peak_memory = 0
  process = psutil.Process(os.getpid())
  def log_memory(prefix: str = ""):
    nonlocal peak_memory
    current_mem = process.memory_info().rss # in bytes
    if current_mem > peak_memory:
      peak_memory = current_mem
    print(f"{prefix} Current Memory: {current_mem // (1024 * 1024)} MB, Peak: {peak_memory // (1024 * 1024)} MB")
  # Minimal browser config
  browser_config = BrowserConfig(
    headless=True,
    verbose=False,  # corrected from 'verbos=False'
    extra_args=["--disable-gpu", "--disable-dev-shm-usage", "--no-sandbox"],
  )
  crawl_config = CrawlerRunConfig(cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS)
  # Create the crawler instance
  crawler = AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config)
  await crawler.start()
  try:
    # We'll chunk the URLs in batches of 'max_concurrent'
    success_count = 0
    fail_count = 0
    for i in range(0, len(urls), max_concurrent):
      batch = urls[i : i + max_concurrent]
      tasks = []
      for j, url in enumerate(batch):
        # Unique session_id per concurrent sub-task
        session_id = f"parallel_session_{i + j}"
        task = crawler.arun(url=url, config=crawl_config, session_id=session_id)
        tasks.append(task)
      # Check memory usage prior to launching tasks
      log_memory(prefix=f"Before batch {i//max_concurrent + 1}: ")
      # Gather results
      results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
      # Check memory usage after tasks complete
      log_memory(prefix=f"After batch {i//max_concurrent + 1}: ")
      # Evaluate results
      for url, result in zip(batch, results):
        if isinstance(result, Exception):
          print(f"Error crawling {url}: {result}")
          fail_count += 1
        elif result.success:
          success_count += 1
        else:
          fail_count += 1
    print(f"\nSummary:")
    print(f" - Successfully crawled: {success_count}")
    print(f" - Failed: {fail_count}")
  finally:
    print("\nClosing crawler...")
    await crawler.close()
    # Final memory log
    log_memory(prefix="Final: ")
    print(f"\nPeak memory usage (MB): {peak_memory // (1024 * 1024)}")
async def main():
  urls = [
    "https://example.com/page1",
    "https://example.com/page2",
    "https://example.com/page3",
    "https://example.com/page4"
  ]
  await crawl_parallel(urls, max_concurrent=2)
if __name__ == "__main__":
  asyncio.run(main())

```

**Notes** :
  * We **reuse** the same `AsyncWebCrawler` instance for all parallel tasks, launching **one** browser. 
  * Each parallel sub-task might get its own `session_id` so they don’t share cookies/localStorage (unless that’s desired). 
  * We limit concurrency to `max_concurrent=2` or 3 to avoid saturating CPU/memory.


## 4. Performance Tips
1. **Extra Browser Args** - `--disable-gpu`, `--no-sandbox` can help in Docker or restricted environments. - `--disable-dev-shm-usage` avoids using `/dev/shm` which can be small on some systems.
2. **Session Reuse** - If your site requires a login or you want to maintain local data across URLs, share the **same** `session_id`. - If you want isolation (each URL fresh), create unique sessions.
3. **Batching** - If you have **many** URLs (like thousands), you can do parallel crawling in chunks (like `max_concurrent=5`). - Use `arun_many()` for a built-in approach if you prefer, but the example above is often more flexible.
4. **Cache** - If your pages share many resources or you’re re-crawling the same domain repeatedly, consider setting `cache_mode=CacheMode.ENABLED` in `CrawlerRunConfig`. - If you need fresh data each time, keep `cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS`.
5. **Hooks** - You can set up global hooks for each crawler (like to block images) or per-run if you want. - Keep them consistent if you’re reusing sessions.
## 5. Summary
  * **One** `AsyncWebCrawler` + multiple calls to `.arun()` is far more efficient than launching a new crawler per URL. 
  * **Sequential** approach with a shared session is simple and memory-friendly for moderate sets of URLs. 
  * **Parallel** approach can speed up large crawls by concurrency, but keep concurrency balanced to avoid overhead. 
  * Close the crawler once at the end, ensuring the browser is only opened/closed once.


For even more advanced memory optimizations or dynamic concurrency patterns, see future sections on hooking or distributed crawling. The patterns above suffice for the majority of multi-URL scenarios—**giving you speed, simplicity, and minimal resource usage**. Enjoy your optimized crawling!
